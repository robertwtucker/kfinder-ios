KFinder is a simple iOS application designed to help with two key factors in a
successful anti-coagulation therapy program: consistent intake of Vitamin K and
regular blood testing.

Features:

- Create reminders to promote regular PT/INR testing
- Search the USDA FoodData Central database to find Vitamin K present in foods
- View detailed food composition breakdowns for Vitamin K and other nutrients
- Automatic data and settings sync via iCloud&reg;

## Background

This project has been an on-going effort to learn/practice the fundamentals of
application development for the iOS platform. Iterations have included versions
using Swift with UI Kit, RxSwift, React Native and now SwiftUI. Interest areas
include:

- SwiftUI
- Application architecture (alternatives to MVVM)
- Testing
- Build automation
