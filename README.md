KFinder is a simple iOS application designed to help with two key factors in a
successful anti-coagulation therapy program: consistent intake of Vitamin K and
regular blood testing.

Features:

- Search the USDAâ€™s Food and Nutrient Database for Dietary Studies
- See a graphical indicator of Vitamin K content in relation to a configurable
  daily intake target
- View detailed food composition breakdowns for Vitamin K and other nutrients
- Create reminders for regular PT/INR testing

## Background

This project has been an on-going effort to learn/practice the fundamentals of
application development for the iOS platform. Iterations have included versions
using Swift with UI Kit, RxSwift and now SwiftUI. Interest areas include:

- SwiftUI
- Application architecture (alternatives to MVVM)
- Testing
- Build automation
